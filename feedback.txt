Your solution is fine. Although your longestCount is 
more complex than necessary.  (I found it a bit hard 
to follow, although I can see what your high-level 
approach was.) 

I wonder if there is a way to add some abstraction to 
that algorithm?

Overall, nice work.

=============
Very thorough.  Nice.

Don't forget to test that your program handles invalid input.
